                <button></button>
                
                <div>
                    <p>The main hero of the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario is always bright and cheerful and instantly recognizable with his blue overalls, red cap, and trademark moustache. <br>He's a trusted friend of Princess Peach, and he and his brother Luigi are known across the land for their acts of bravery.<br>Mario excels at sports including tennis, golf, baseball, soccer, and even kart racing. He's good at all of them! He's a plumber by profession but is really a jack of all trades.<br>He uses his masterful jumping ability and a variety of power-ups to take on his archrival, Bowser.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Mario's brother and fellow hero of the Mushroom Kingdom. Luigi is instantly recognizable in his
                        trademark green hat and green shirt. <br>Luigi is kind but can be a bit nervous, especially around
                        ghosts. However, his abilities are on par with Mario's, so when these brothers team up, there's
                        nothing they can't achieve.<br>Luigi is taller and can jump higher than Mario. If you look closely,
                        you may also notice that the shape of his moustache is a bit different as well.</p>

                        does his best to help Mario and Luigi in their efforts to protect the Mushroom Kingdom from Bowser,
